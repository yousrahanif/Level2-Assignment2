1. What is PostgreSQL?
Answer: PostgreSQL is a tool by which we can store data and manage that data later. We can think as a contacts App on our phone. Where we save our contact and later on we can search and use those number, or edit or delete that number. 

2. Explain the Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL.
Answer: Primary key is a column or can be set of columns in a table. With that primary key we can uniquely identify each row of the table. Lets say we have two Raju Ahmed in our school. So we have to make a way where we can uniquely identify each Raju. Either we can do with the student id because we know  each student have unique id. Or lets say two Rajus have different date of birth. So we can combine name and date of birth and consider that as Primary key because with that we can identify each Raju.  

Foreign key also can be a column or multiple column. It refers to the primary key of the another table. Lets say we have another table where we are storing course taken by students.
